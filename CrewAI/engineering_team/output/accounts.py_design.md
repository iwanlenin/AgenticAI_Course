#### `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
Calculates the total value of the portfolio (cash + shares).
- Returns the total value as a float.

#### `get_profit_loss(self) -> float`
Calculates the profit or loss from the initial deposit.
- Returns the profit or loss as a float.

#### `get_holdings(self) -> dict`

#### `get_transaction_history(self) -> list`
Returns the list of all transactions made by the user.

### Example Usage:

```python
account = Account(account_id="12345", initial_deposit=1000.0)
account.deposit(500.0)
account.buy_shares("AAPL", 5)
account.sell_shares("AAPL", 2)
balance = account.balance
holdings = account.get_holdings()
transaction_history = account.get_transaction_history()
portfolio_value = account.get_portfolio_value()
profit_loss = account.get_profit_loss()
```

This module is fully self-contained and is designed to be ready for testing or integration with a user interface. It ensures that all operations respect the rules around non-negative balances and valid transactions.
